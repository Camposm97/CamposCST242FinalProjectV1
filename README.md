# CamposCST242FinalProjectV1
   Created on Nov. 2017.  The purpose of the program is to represent an accountant's general journal.  You can record transactions to the journal, then view those transaction or see if the transactions you entered passes a trial balance.  You can create and delete these journals that connects to a database using MySQL.  
   To run the program you need to edit the directory in the code and have MySQL installed and a database called "accounting101".  Also, you need to have the jar file in the SharedLibraries folder to be an external archive of the program to connect to MySQL and change the username and password in Config.txt.  
   NOTE: One of the classes are incomplete and not implmeneted in the program and that is Achievement.java 
   NOTE: I do not recommend running this file. It will require a few changes in order to run it properly.
